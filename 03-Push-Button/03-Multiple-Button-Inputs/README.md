# 03 - Multiple Button Iputs

## Objective

Create a program using an ESP32 where pressing each button lights LED1 up, while pressing both buttons simultaneously lights LED2 up.

## Components Used

- ESP32
- 2 LEDs
- 2 220 Ω resistors
- 2 Push buttons
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Concepts

- GPIO Output
- HIGH and LOW states
- pinMode()
- INPUT_PULLUP
- digitalWrite()
- if/else statements
- variables

## Wiring

- LED Anode → GPIO 18
- LED Cathode → GND (through a 220 Ω resistor)
- LED Anode → GPIO 23
- LED Cathode → GND (through a 220 Ω resistor)
- Push button 1 pin 1 → GPIO 5
- Push button 1 pin 2 → GND
- Push button 2 pin 1 → GPIO 22
- Push button 2 pin 2 → GND

## Expected Result

When Button 1 or 2 is pressed, LED 1 lights up. If both Button 1 and Button 2 are pressed simultaneously then LED 2 lights up.

## What I Learned

- What Input pullups are and how to use them
- How to properly if/else statements
