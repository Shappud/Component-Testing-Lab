# 08 - Reaction Time Tester

## Objective

Create a program using an ESP32 where it tests your reaction time ny pressing a button when the LED lights up.

## Components Used

- ESP32
- LEDs
- 220 Ω resistor
- Push button
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Concepts

- GPIO Output
- HIGH and LOW states
- pinMode()
- INPUT_PULLUP
- digitalWrite()
- Debouncing Mechanics
- if statements
- variables

## Wiring

- LED1 Anode → GPIO 21 (through a 220 Ω resistor)
- LED1 Cathode → GND 
- Push button pin 1 → GPIO 22
- Push button pin 2 → GND

## Expected Result

A LED will randomly light up in a timespan of 5 seconds. When the LED lights up, a timer starts and pressing the button will record the total time that has passed since the LED turned on.

## What I Learned

- How to use millis() correctly 
- Timing without delay()
- States
